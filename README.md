# DKU Pulse

While there are many sleep trackers and study trackers on Baidu, Google Play and Apple Store, there are currently no tools to track the correlation between these two factors, particularly in the context of college. Sleep plays a huge part in productivity, affecting our focus, concentration and alertness, thus greatly impacting one's academic performance. 

By tracking the quality and amount of sleep concurrently with the hours spent studying and overall grades, we will be able to provide personalized recommendations to improve productivity or direct students to DKU available resources. 

For instance, if a student is studying over 12 hours a day with little sleep, Pulse may suggest increasing the number of quality sleep hours to a certain amount. This way, students can quickly identify factors and alter sleep habits to further improve their overall productivity and wellbeing.

Our goal is to study how sleep has an impact on course performance and productivity. We hope to use the statistics obtained to recommend and inform students on how much time to set aside for each course to achieve a particular grade. In addition to recommending healthy habits such as more sleep, exercise and water intake, to improve their physical health which can overall improve mental health and boost productivity. Our main goal is to compile relevant information about how to be successful in college through a concise, fun and easy to access format for DKU students, and college students generally in future.
